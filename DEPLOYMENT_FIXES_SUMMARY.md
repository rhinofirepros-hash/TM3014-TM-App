# ðŸŽ¯ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT FIXES SUMMARY

## âœ… ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED FOR tm.rhinofirepro.com

Replaced `/railway-setup/server.py` with the complete Rhino Platform server containing ALL fixes.

1. **âœ… DELETE /api/installers/{id}** 
   - FIXES: "Cannot delete crew members"
   - Returns 200 instead of 405 Method Not Allowed

   - GET /api/tm-tags (list all T&M tags)
   - POST /api/tm-tags (create T&M tag)

3. **âœ… PDF Export & Preview Endpoints**
   - FIXES: "Previewing T&M tag takes to black screen"
   - GET /api/tm-tags/{id}/pdf (exports proper PDF with ReportLab)
   - GET /api/tm-tags/{id}/preview (returns formatted HTML preview)

4. **âœ… Date Serialization Fix**
   - FIXES: Worker creation failures with hire_date
   - Uses `model_dump(mode="json")` instead of `.dict()` for proper MongoDB serialization

### ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT READY:
