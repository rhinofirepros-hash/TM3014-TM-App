The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development process, addressing both core features and numerous bugs. Initially, the focus was on a significant architectural pivot to a unified schema, which required a data migration and expansion of financial and GC dashboard modules. A critical  import error was resolved. The primary challenge became stabilizing the GC Dashboard's simplified 4-digit PIN system, which involved extensive debugging across backend () and frontend components (, , ). This included resolving server configuration issues, data consistency problems, authentication flow mismatches between admin and GC logins, and prop handling errors. Concurrently, comprehensive UI theme implementations using glass morphism and  components were applied across the GC Dashboard and Financial tabs, alongside mobile responsiveness fixes. New product features like plan submittal tracking and updated employee roles were also integrated.

Rhino Fire Protection's core product is a web-based Time and Material Daily Tag App (TM3014) for foremen to manage labor, materials, equipment, and expenses. It generates branded, signable PDFs for GCs, emphasizing user-friendliness and professional branding. Key features include a T&M Form, PDF generation with digital signatures, PIN-based authentication, Crew management, a Dashboard and Reports with project analytics, and bulk PDF export. The app utilizes EmailJS integration, Rhino Fire Protection branding with a modern UI (dark/light theme, glass morphism), and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. A Project Overview System manages the full project lifecycle. Cost calculations use  and project-specific labor rates for detailed profit breakdowns. Bidirectional sync auto-populates T&M tags from crew logs, and editing is enabled for projects, T&M tags, and crew logs. Recent user-requested additions include clickable dashboard cards, a project type selector, forecasted schedule fields, refined T&M profit calculation, a unified schema for Invoices, Payables, Cashflow Forecasting, Profitability, and Inspections modules, a GC Dashboard with an auto-regenerating 4-digit PIN system, T&M tag submission without signatures, plan submittal tracking (In Design, Submitted, Corrections, Approval, auto-approved for T&M), and updated employee roles (e.g., Fire Sprinkler Installation Personnel).

The application comprises a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.


-   : This is the actively running backend server. It was initially missing GC dashboard and PIN management functionalities. These were migrated from , including  imports, GC collection definitions, PIN generation/regeneration logic, and GC-related API endpoints (, ). Crucially, project lookup logic was fixed to use  consistently, and  errors were resolved in . The  endpoint now uses a  Pydantic model for robust request body validation.
-   : This file was updated to define a  enum (, , , ) and integrate , , and  fields into the  and  models. The  and  fields were also formally added to the  model for the GC PIN system.
-   : Manages global routing and authentication state. It was modified to correctly pass the  prop to  and  to resolve prop mismatch errors. A new route  was added for the dedicated  component, and logic for handling GC routes was adjusted.
-   : The General Contractor's main dashboard. An initial  import error ( icon) was fixed. It underwent significant styling updates to adopt the glass morphism theme with  components and was modified to ensure  (not ) was correctly imported and used. All hover-based motion effects were removed, retaining only subtle color transitions.
-   : Displays financial data (Invoices, Payables, etc.). Received comprehensive styling updates for theme cohesion, converting  components to  and applying glass morphism. A JSX syntax error () and a duplicate  import were resolved, and responsive table styling was implemented.
-   : A newly created component for a dedicated, simplified GC login. It was modified to function as a PIN-only login, automatically discovering the project based on the 4-digit PIN, removing the need for GCs to input a long project ID. Error handling was enhanced, and it was updated to correctly receive and use the  prop.
-   : Admin interface for managing GC projects. It was updated to correctly display both Project ID and PIN during PIN generation, removing the previous  interface. It now uses  components with consistent dark theme styling and has all hover animations removed from project cards to improve usability.
-   : The primary admin login component. It was modified to remove the explicit display of admin PIN  for security and to integrate into a unified login system capable of handling both admin and GC PINs.
-   : Manages project creation and editing. UI elements for the new plan submittal fields (, , ) were added, and date validation was implemented for  and  to prevent Invalid time value runtime errors.
-   : Manages crew details and employee roles. The  array was updated to include roles specific to fire sprinkler installation (e.g., 'Helper', 'Fitter', 'Journeyman', 'Foreman', 'Superintendent', 'Project Manager').
-   : The custom UI component providing animated card styling. It exports , which was previously mis-imported as  in other components, leading to compilation errors. This discrepancy was corrected throughout the codebase.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent  console error during GC login and fine-tuning the visual hover effects on cards as per user feedback. The user reported the specific console error for GC login and requested to retain  on cards while ensuring all motion/hover animations were removed. The engineer identified that the  component in  was missing the  prop. This was corrected by explicitly passing the  function as  to the  component. Concurrently, in , the styling was adjusted to reintroduce  and  to cards, providing a subtle visual feedback on hover without triggering any disruptive shadow or movement effects, thus ensuring UI consistency without interfering with user interaction.

<optional_next_step>
Test the GC login using a fresh PIN and verify the restored hover colors on cards.
