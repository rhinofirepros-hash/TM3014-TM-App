   - Invoice data (amounts, due dates, payment status)
   - Progress updates (milestones, completion status)
   - Inspection requests (dates, status, results)
   - T&M submissions (hours, costs, crew assignments)

4. Auto-update project dashboard:
   - Create new projects from RFPs/awards
   - Update project status from progress emails
   - Add invoices from billing emails
   - Schedule inspections from request emails
   - Log T&M data from crew reports

5. Review queue for manual override:

   - Manual corrections improve LLM accuracy
