# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
#

Authentication now working on live site tm.rhinofirepro.com."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Comprehensive testing and polishing of the Time & Material Daily Tag App with Project Management System. Recent major updates include: 1) Project-specific labor rates instead of fixed $95/hr, 2) Updated employee schema from base_pay/burden_cost to single hourly_rate for true cost calculations, 3) Bidirectional sync between crew logs and T&M tags, 4) Fixed edit functionality for both T&M tags and crew logs, 5) Enhanced cost analytics showing true costs vs billed amounts with labor markup profit.

The system generates random 4-digit PINs (1000-9999) and '2024' was not assigned. ✅ WORKING PINS DISCOVERED: Found 5 valid PIN combinations ready for frontend testing: PIN '2602' works with '3rd Ave' project (ID: 68cc802f8d44fcd8015b39b8), PIN '2568' works with 'Full Contract Project Test' (ID: 68cc802f8d44fcd8015b39b9), PIN '6614' works with 'Time & Material Only Project Test' (ID: 68cc802f8d44fcd8015b39ba), PIN '4313' works with 'Backward Compatibility Test Project' (ID: 68cc802f8d44fcd8015b39bb), PIN '7503' works with 'Invalid Project Type Test' (ID: 68cc802f8d44fcd8015b39bc). ✅ AUTHENTICATION VERIFIED: All discovered PINs successfully authenticate via POST /api/gc/login-simple with proper single-use behavior (PINs regenerate after successful login). ✅ SOLUTION PROVIDED: Frontend testing should use any of the 5 valid PIN combinations listed above instead of the non-existent PIN '2024'.
